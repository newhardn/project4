// stegoDestroy --- insert info in a BMP image file
// Created by nnewh on 11/9/2023.
//
// 4. Write a program, stegoDestroy.c that will destroy any information hidden in a file, assuming that the information
// hiding method in stego.c might have been used. Your program should take a bmp file as input, and produce a bmp file
// as output. Visually, the output file must be identical to the input file.
//
// 5. Test stegoDestroy.c on aliceStego.bmp. Verify that the output file image is undamaged. What information does
// stego.c extract from your output file?
